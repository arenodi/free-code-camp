# arenodi's freeCodeCamping Learning Trail

Hello There! Welcome to my freeCodeCamp learning trail.
Here you are going to be able to check the projects that I created.
For those who do not know how freeCodeCamp bootcamps works, I'm going to try to explain it with my words in list form:

1. freeCodeCamp is a community that work together to structure courses based on current technologies;
1. There are bootcamps in web development, security and data science;
1. It is a great resource for learning javascript;
1. It is project based learning;
1. To get certified, you need to build 5 certification projects in each bootcamp.
1. Then get all of the project tests to pass to be able to claim your certification.
1. Most important: It's completely free!

If you haven't heard about it, you should definitely [check it out!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and check out my [profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/arenodi)!
